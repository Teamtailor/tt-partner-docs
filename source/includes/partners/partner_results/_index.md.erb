Actions let you surface contextual buttons on the candidate's partner result card. Provide any `buttonText` you want rendered in the UI and an `endpoint` relative to the your partner base URL. When a recruiter clicks the button we send POST request to `{base-url}/{endpoint}` with the same partner event as [originally sent](#webhooks) allowing you to let user trigger additional operations.

The individual scores for the assessment criteria included in the [Webhook config](#webhook-config).

Attribute        | Type    | Description
-----------------|---------|------------
id               | string  | Your unique identifier for the assessment criteria specified in the webhook config.
score            | integer | Must be between 0 and 100.
