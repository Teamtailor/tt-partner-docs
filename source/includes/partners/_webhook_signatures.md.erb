# Webhook signatures
To validate authenticity of webhooks sent by Teamtailor we include a `Teamtailor-Signature` header in each request. The header contains a [HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC) and allows you to validate that the webhook was actually sent by Teamtailor. Webhooks signatures are optional and if you'd like to use it, please contact us on partner@teamtailor.com we'll provide you with the secret key needed.

## Signature structure
The structure of `Teamtailor-Signature` is a timestamp (to prevent [replay attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack)) followed by a comma and two or more schemes separated by commans. The current only valid signature scheme is `v1` and the latest scheme should always be used to prevent [downgrading attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downgrade_attack).

```
# Example signature
Teamtailor-Signature: t=1539756759,
  v1=2c26b46b68ffc68ff99b453c1d30413413422d706483bfa0f98a5e886266e7ae,
  v0=fcde2b2edba56bf408601fb721fe9b5c338d10ee429ea04fae5511b68fbf8fb9
```

## Checking signatures
To validate a signature you may first check that the timestamp is in valid range (eg five minutes). This range is, however, up to you. 

After checking the timestamp you can verify the hash by computing it yourself and compare it to the lastest hash included in the request, `vX`. If it match, Teamtailor sent the webhook.

```
# Computing the hash
hash = sha256(timestamp + "." + payload, secret_key)
```

## Example implementation (Node)

```js
// Bundled with Node
const crypto = require('crypto');

// External dependencies
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

// Webhook secret as environment variable
const SECRET = process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET;

app.post('/webhook', bodyParser.raw({type: 'application/json'}), (req, res) => {
  const signaturePattern = /^t=(\d+),v\d=(\w+),.+$/;
  const signature = req.headers['teamtailor-signature'];
  const [_, timestamp, cHmac] = signaturePattern.exec(signature);
  const payload = `${timestamp}.${payload}`;
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', SECRET)
    .update(payload, 'utf-8')
    .digest('hex');
  if (cHmac === hmac) {
    // Signature check passed.
    // If you want to prevent replay attacks, check timestamp as well.
    return res.status(200).send();
  }
  return res.status(401).send();
})
```
