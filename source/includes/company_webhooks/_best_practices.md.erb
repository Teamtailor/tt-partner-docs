# Best Practices

Follow these best practices to ensure reliable and secure webhook integration with Teamtailor.

## Implementation Recommendations

### Webhook Processing

1. **Verify signatures** - Always verify the signature before processing webhooks
2. **Process asynchronously** - Handle webhooks asynchronously to respond quickly
3. **Idempotency** - Design your webhook handlers to be idempotent (can safely receive the same webhook multiple times)
4. **Return quickly** - Respond with a 200 status code as soon as possible, then process the webhook

### Error Handling

1. **Graceful failures** - Handle errors gracefully and log issues for debugging
2. **Webhook monitoring** - Monitor webhook deliveries and failures
3. **Handle retries** - Be prepared for webhooks to be retried if your endpoint is temporarily unavailable

## Performance Considerations

1. **Selective subscriptions** - Only subscribe to the events you need
2. **Efficient processing** - Process webhooks efficiently to avoid bottlenecks
3. **Scalable infrastructure** - Ensure your webhook endpoint can handle bursts of traffic

## Security Guidelines

1. **HTTPS only** - Always use HTTPS for webhook endpoints
2. **Signature verification** - Always verify webhook signatures
3. **Secrets management** - Securely store your webhook signature key
4. **Input validation** - Validate webhook payloads before processing

### Handling Duplicate Events

Webhooks might be delivered multiple times, especially during retries:
- Use a unique identifier (like the event ID) to detect duplicates
- Make your webhook processing idempotent
