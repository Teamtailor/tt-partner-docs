# Partner Webhook Setups

Partner webhook setups are a specialized type of webhook system specifically designed for Teamtailor integration partners.

## Key Differences from Company Webhooks

Partner webhook setups differ from company webhooks in several important ways:

1. **Automatic Activation**: When a client activates a partner integration that has a webhook setup, webhooks are automatically activated for that company without requiring additional configuration.

2. **Partner-Managed Endpoints**: The webhook endpoint is configured by the partner, not the client company.

3. **Different Authentication**: Partner webhooks use a different authorization header format and signature verification method.

4. **Controlled Access**: This feature is enabled by Teamtailor specifically for approved integration partners.

## Authentication for Partner Webhooks

Partner webhook requests use a different authentication system than company webhooks:

### Headers
- `Authorization`: Bearer token (JWT-encoded provider keys)
- `Teamtailor-Signature`: Format with timestamp (e.g., `t=1539756759,v1=hmac,v0=hmac_fake`)
- `Teamtailor-Api-Token`: API key when available
- `Teamtailor-Host`: Current TeamtailorStack host
- `Content-Type`: application/json

Company webhooks use a Base64-encoded HMAC SHA-256 signature calculated from the resource ID, while partner webhooks use a JWT-based authentication system with additional verification headers.

## Setup Process

To set up partner webhook integrations:

1. Contact Teamtailor at integrations@teamtailor.com to request partner integration status
2. Teamtailor will enable the webhook setup feature for your partner account
3. Configure your endpoint to properly handle and authenticate the incoming webhooks
