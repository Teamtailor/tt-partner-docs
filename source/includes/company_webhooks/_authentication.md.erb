# Authentication & Security

Teamtailor uses multiple security measures to ensure webhook deliveries are secure and authentic.

## Webhook Security

Each webhook request includes:

1. A `TT-Signature` header containing the signature
2. The same signature in the request body
3. Optional authorization headers for partner-specific webhooks

This allows you to verify that the webhook is legitimately from Teamtailor.

## HTTPS Requirements

All webhook endpoints must use HTTPS to ensure data is encrypted in transit. Teamtailor will not send webhooks to non-HTTPS URLs.

## Authentication Headers

Based on the implementation in `tt-webhooks`, the following headers may be present:

```javascript
const headers = {
  "TT-Signature": signature,
};

if (providerKey) {
  headers.authorization = `Bearer ${providerKey}`;
}

if (apiKey) {
  headers["teamtailor-api-token"] = apiKey;
}
```

The standard header for signature verification is `TT-Signature`.

## Retry Mechanism

If your endpoint is temporarily unavailable or returns a non-2xx status code, Teamtailor will retry the webhook delivery:

- First retry: Shortly after the initial attempt
- Subsequent retries: Using an exponential backoff strategy

After multiple failed attempts, if the webhook still fails to deliver, it will be logged as a failed delivery.
