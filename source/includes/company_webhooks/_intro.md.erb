# Introduction

Teamtailor's Company Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when data changes in Teamtailor. This enables seamless integration with your existing systems without constantly polling the API.

## Types of Webhook Systems in Teamtailor

Teamtailor offers two different webhook systems:

1. **Company Webhooks** - These are activated directly by companies in their Teamtailor settings. They allow companies to receive notifications about their own recruitment activities to any endpoint they configure.

2. **Partner Webhook Setups** - These are part of the partner integration system. When a client activates a partner integration that has a webhook setup, webhooks will be automatically activated for that company and sent to the endpoint configured in the partner's webhook setup. These use a different authentication signature format and are enabled by Teamtailor for specific partner integrations.

This documentation focuses on Company Webhooks. For information about Partner Webhook Setups, please refer to the [Partners documentation section](/partners/#webhooks).
