# Event Types

Company Webhooks use a consistent naming pattern for events:

```
resource_name.action
```

Where:
* `resource_name` is the object type (candidate, job, etc.)
* `action` is what occurred (create, update, destroy)

## Common Events

### Candidate Events
* `candidate.create` - New candidate created
* `candidate.update` - Candidate information updated
* `candidate.destroy` - Candidate deleted

### Job Events
* `job.create` - New job created
* `job.update` - Job information updated
* `job.destroy` - Job deleted

### Job Application Events
* `job_application.create` - New application submitted
* `job_application.update` - Application updated (e.g., stage change, rejection)
* `job_application.destroy` - Application deleted

<aside class="warning">
<strong>Important:</strong> When handling job application rejection events, if your system notifies candidates about rejection, you must respect the <code>transparent_recruiting_visible_at</code> date as the earliest date for candidate notification. Do not notify candidates before this date.
