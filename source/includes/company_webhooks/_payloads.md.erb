# Webhook Payloads

When an event occurs, Teamtailor sends a JSON payload to your endpoint containing details about the event.

## Payload Structure

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "event_name": "job.update",
    "data": {
      "id": "2",
      "type": "jobs",
      "attributes": {
        "title": "IT Designer 1",
        "body": "<p>Job description...</p>",
        "company-name": "Teamtailor",
        "cover-letter-requirement": "cover_letter_optional",
        "created-at": "2023-02-08T10:10:13.611+01:00",
        "employment-level": "none",
        "employment-type": "none",
        "human-status": "archived",
        "internal": false,
        "remote-status": "none",
        "status": "archived",
        "tags": [],
        "updated-at": "2023-02-22T22:10:48.705+01:00"
      }
    }
  },
  "signature": "YzU1N2FhOTUwMjlkNTFiMGM5NjIxNTEyODc5NGY5ZjgxZWNkMmNkZTZhNmIxYmI2YmM3NmVmYmQ1ZGZiMDg0Zg=="
}
```

The standard payload structure includes:

1. `payload`: Object containing:
   - `event_name`: The type of event (e.g., "job.update")
   - `data`: Resource data with:
     - `id`: Resource identifier
     - `type`: Resource type (e.g., "jobs", "candidates")
     - `attributes`: Resource-specific attributes
2. `signature`: Base64-encoded signature for verification

For `destroy` events, the data structure is simpler but follows the same overall structure.

## Resource-Specific Attributes

Each resource type includes different attributes in the payload:

### Candidate
- first_name, last_name, email, phone etc.
- tags, custom fields, status

### Job
- title, body, status, company-name etc.
- employment details, dates, tags

### Job Application
The job application resource includes the following attributes:

- `id` - Application identifier
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp
- `job_id` - Associated job identifier
- `job_title` - Title of the associated job
- `last_moved_at` - Timestamp when application was last moved between stages
- `stage_name` - Current stage name
- `referring_site` - Site where candidate found the job
- `referring_url` - URL where candidate found the job
- `referer_id` - Referer identifier
- `rejected_at` - Rejection timestamp (if applicable)
- `promotion_id` - Associated promotion identifier
- `company_uuid` - Company unique identifier
- `transparent_recruiting_visible_at` - Earliest date when rejection can be communicated to candidate

<aside class="warning">
<strong>Transparent Recruiting Compliance:</strong> If your system notifies candidates about application status changes (especially rejections), you must respect the <code>transparent_recruiting_visible_at</code> date. This represents the earliest date when you can notify the candidate about their rejection status.
</aside>

## Headers

Each webhook request includes these headers:

- `TT-Signature`: Signature for verifying webhook authenticity
- `Authorization`: Bearer token (for partner webhooks, if applicable)
- `teamtailor-api-token`: API token (if applicable)

<aside class="notice">
Note that attributes follow kebab-case naming convention (e.g., "company-name", "remote-status").
