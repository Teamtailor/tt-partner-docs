# Setting Up Webhooks

## Prerequisites

To use Company Webhooks, you need:

1. The Webhooks feature enabled for your company
2. Administrator permissions in Teamtailor
3. An endpoint that can receive webhook notifications (HTTPS required)

## Configuration Steps

1. In Teamtailor dashboard, go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Webhooks**
2. Click **Add webhook** and provide:
   * **Label**: A descriptive name (e.g., "CRM Integration")
   * **Webhook URL**: Your HTTPS endpoint
   * **Events**: Select the events you want to subscribe to
3. Save the automatically generated signature key for security verification
4. Test the connection to ensure your endpoint is receiving events

You can create multiple webhook subscriptions with different event filters to organize your integrations efficiently.
