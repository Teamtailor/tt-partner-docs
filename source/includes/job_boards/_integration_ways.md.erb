# Possible integration ways

Teamtailor offers several ways to for your job board to integrate with us:

## 1. HTTP Webhooks

When a user creates/updates/removes a job ad Teamtailor will send a JSON request that contains the job ad data.

## 2. Always included XML feed

Teamtailor generates a unique XML feed for a single job board containing all job ads from custromers 
who activated the integration. Itâ€™s generated three times a day. 
The job board will receive a unique url to the XML feed. 
The feed contains a current state of job ads, that means if the job is unlisted on Teamtailor it will be removed from the XML feed - job board should remove it as well.
An example feed is here. Read more [here](#xml-feeds).

## 3. Premium XML feed

XML feed containing all job ads selected by the user to promote. 
It works in the same way as described in [Always included XML feed](#2-always-included-xml-feed), except the XML feed 
contains only selected job ads. Each job ad node in the XML feed contains a special tag used to identify the company.

## 4. Email with job data

Job board provider receives an email with job ad data when the user selects it to be promoted.
Teamtailor sends email when a job ad is created/updated/removed.
