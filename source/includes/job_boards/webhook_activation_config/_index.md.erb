# Webhook activation config

## About activation config

```json
{
  "config": {
    "fields": [
      {
        "id": "clientId",
        "type": "text",
        "label": "Client ID",
        "required": true,
        "description": "Please insert the Client ID"
      },
      {
        "id": "clientSecret",
        "type": "password",
        "label": "Client SECRET",
        "required": true,
        "description": "Please insert the Client secret"
      },
      {
        "id": "language",
        "type": "select",
        "label": "Test Default language",
        "description": "Select the default test language",
        "options": [
          {
            "id": "1",
            "label": "English"
          },
          {
            "id": "2",
            "label": "French"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### This config is visible during trigger activation in settings page

This is the place where you should collect the data you need in order to identify user.
You can render a form that will need to be filled to enable integration. It could be email, passwords, api tokens.

## Example implementation of middleware

```js
module.exports = async (req, res, next) => {
  const [JWTtoken] = req.headers.authorization.split('Bearer ');

  try {
    const decoded = JWT.verify(JWTtoken, TT_JOB_BOARD_API_KEY);
    req.auth = decoded;
    return next();
  } catch (error) {
    if (req.path.includes('config')) {
      return res.json({
        config: {
          fields: [
            {
              type: 'error',
              message: 'Wrong authorization token',
            },
          ],
        },
      });
    }
    return next(error);
  }
};

```

After user will finish the installation Teamtailor will turn this form into a JSON web token
The token will be included in any request to `GET ${BASE_URL}/config`
 and `POST ${BASE_URL/webhook}`
Payload can be verified with TT_JOB_BOARD_API_KEY

## Setting up activation config

Create an activation config using the same elements as in the webhook config.
You have several options on how to implement activation config:

1. Setting static config on a Job board using API with at least one input field (recommended)
1. Implementing dynamic config that will call your endpoint every time user will go to your integration in the settings page

## Set the static activation config on Job board

```http
PUT https://api.teamtailor.com/channel/v1/channels/{INTEGRATION_ID} HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Token abc123abc123
X-Api-Version: <%= config[:api_version] %>
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "data": {
    "id": 99,
    "type":"channels",
    "attributes":{
      "activation-config": {
        "config": {
          "fields": [
            {
              "id":"token",
              "type":"text",
              "label":"Example Token",
              "required":true
            },
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Set the static config on job board resource. The fields values filled by the user will be
turned into JSONWebToken. You can mark options required

## Dynamic config

Sometimes you may need to dynamically render the content of the fields
You can achieve that with setting the empty object in webhook-activation-config.
Each time the user will go to settings/your integration we will call

`GET ${BASE_URL}/activation?company_id=xyz`

and try to render returned config fields

```http
PUT https://api.teamtailor.com/channel/v1/channels/{INTEGRATION_ID} HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Token abc123abc123
X-Api-Version: <%= config[:api_version] %>
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "data": {
    "id": 99,
    "type":"channels",
    "attributes":{
      "webhook-activation-config": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## Turn on dynamic activation config

In order to use this option you need to update dynamic-activation-config property using PUT /channel

```http
PUT https://api.teamtailor.com/channel/v1/channels/{INTEGRATION_ID} HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Token abc123abc123
X-Api-Version: <%= config[:api_version] %>
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "data": {
    "id": 99,
    "type":"channels",
    "attributes":{
      "dynamic-activation-config": true
    }
  }
}
```
